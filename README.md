# Simple Python Calculator

A basic command-line calculator program written in Python that performs arithmetic operations based on user input.

## Description

This simple calculator program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers. The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and select an operation, then calculates and displays the result.

## Features

- Supports four basic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/)
- Accepts decimal numbers
- Includes error handling for division by zero
- Validates operation input
- Displays results in a clear, readable format

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Use

1. Run the program:
   ```
   python simple_calculator.py
   ```

2. Follow the prompts:
   - Enter the first number
   - Enter the second number
   - Enter the operation symbol (+, -, *, /)

3. View the result displayed in the format: `num1 operation num2 = result`

## Example Usage

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): +
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
The result of addition is 15.0
```

```
Enter the first number: 20
Enter the second number: 4
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): /
20.0 / 4.0 = 5.0
The result of division is 5.0
```

## Error Handling

The program includes basic error handling:

- For division by zero: "Error: Division by zero is not allowed."
- For invalid operations: "Invalid operation. Please use +, -, *, or /"

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for this calculator:
- Support for more complex operations (exponents, square roots, etc.)
- Memory functions
- Support for multiple operations in sequence
- Graphical user interface (GUI)
- History of calculations
